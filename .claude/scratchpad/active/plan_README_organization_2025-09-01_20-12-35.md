## Repository Structure Analysis

### Main Tools:
1. **scratchpad.sh** - Temporary workspace for agent notes
   - Commands: new, list, view, edit, append, complete, filed, archive, search
   - Creates organized scratchpad files for different purposes (task, debug, plan)
   - Helps file completed notes to proper .claude directories

2. **claude-rag-lite.sh** - Knowledge retrieval system
   - Uses SQLite FTS5 for fast full-text search
   - Commands: build (index), query (search), stats (info)
   - Python modules in rag_modules/ for indexing and searching

### Knowledge Base Directories (.claude/):
- metadata/ - Component analysis, dependency info
- code_index/ - Code relationships, function mappings
- debug_history/ - Debugging sessions, error fixes
- patterns/ - Implementation patterns, best practices
- qa/ - Questions answered, problems solved
- cheatsheets/ - Quick references, common commands
- delta/ - Change logs, updates
- anchors/ - Important code locations
- scratchpad/ - Temporary working notes (active/archive)
