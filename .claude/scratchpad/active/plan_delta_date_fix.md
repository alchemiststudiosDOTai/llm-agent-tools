# Implementation Plan – delta_date_fix
**Date:** 2025-09-01 22:25:02  
**Phase:** Planning (Explicit Steps + Review)

## Goal
Concrete, reviewed plan based on Research phase.

## Steps
1. File: `<file>` – Change: `<what>` – Test: `<command>`
2. File: `<file>` – Change: `<what>` – Test: `<command>`
3. File: `<file>` – Change: `<what>` – Test: `<command>`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given `<condition>` → When `<action>` → Then `<result>`
- Include tests, metrics, or logs verifying success.

## Rollback Plan
- How to revert if tests fail or requirements change.

## Open Questions
- Anything blocking final approval before coding.

## Steps
1. File: `.claude/delta/rag_db_rebuild_*.md` – Change: replace `- Date: $(date ...)` with real timestamp – Test: grep for `$(date` returns no hits.
2. Index: Rebuild incremental – Change: run indexer – Test: index count increases or updates.
3. Search: Validate updated content – Change: query for the exact timestamp – Test: result contains updated line.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No `$(date` placeholders in delta logs; search returns the new concrete date string.

## Rollback Plan
- Re-edit the file and re-run indexer.
